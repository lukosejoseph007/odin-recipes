    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large skillet or pan, heat the cooking oil over medium heat. Add
        mustard seeds and let them splutter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the chopped ginger, garlic, and green chillies. Sauté until the
        raw aroma disappears.
      </li>
      <li>Add the sliced onions and cook until they turn golden brown.</li>
      <li>
        Toss in the chopped carrots and green beans. Sauté for a few minutes
        until they are tender yet crisp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle 3/4 teaspoon of salt, Kashmiri chilli powder, coriander powder,
        turmeric powder, and garam masala. Mix well to coat the vegetables
        evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower the heat and add the cooked rice to the pan. Gently toss the rice
        with the spiced vegetables until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with 1.25 teaspoons of salt. Push the
        rice mixture to one side of the pan and pour the beaten eggs into the
        empty space.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scramble the eggs until they are cooked through, breaking them into
        smaller pieces as they cook.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, mix the scrambled eggs with the rice and vegetables. Add 1/4 cup of
        water to keep the rice moist and prevent sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle lime or lemon juice over the egg rice, and sprinkle black pepper
        powder for an extra kick of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with fresh coriander leaves, and your delicious egg rice is
        ready to be served hot.
      </li>
    </ol>

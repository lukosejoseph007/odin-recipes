      <li>Coriander powder - 2 tablespoons</li>
      <li>Chilli powder - 2/3 tablespoon</li>
      <li>Chicken masala - 1 tablespoon</li>

      <li>Water - 1.5 cup (360ml)</li>
      <li>Curry leaves - 2 sprigs</li>
      <li>Black pepper powder - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large pot or skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onions
        and sauté until they become translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add green chilies and ginger-garlic paste to the onions. Sauté for
        another 1-2 minutes until the raw aroma of ginger-garlic disappears.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, add the cleaned chicken pieces to the pot and mix well with the
        onion mixture. Cook the chicken for about 5 minutes, stirring
        occasionally, until it starts to brown slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add salt, turmeric powder, coriander powder, chili powder, and chicken
        masala to the chicken. Stir everything together, ensuring the spices
        coat the chicken evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, add diced tomatoes and give it a quick mix. Cook for 2-3 minutes
        until the tomatoes become soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in 1.5 cups of water and bring the mixture to a boil. Once it
        starts boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the curry
        simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked and
        tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the curry simmers, add the curry leaves for an authentic Kerala
        touch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the chicken is cooked, check the seasoning and adjust salt and
        spices according to your taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, sprinkle black pepper powder over the curry, giving it a mild
        spicy kick.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Your quick and easy Kerala-style chicken curry is now ready to be served.
      Enjoy this delightful dish with steamed rice, appam, or Kerala parotta for
      an authentic South Indian dining experience!

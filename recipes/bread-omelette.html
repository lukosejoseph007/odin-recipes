      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and add 2 teaspoons of butter,
        letting it melt and coat the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chopped onions, green chillies, and curry leaves to the pan.
        Saut√© until the onions turn translucent and the mixture becomes
        aromatic.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the whisked egg mixture onto the pan and spread it evenly.</li>
      <li>
        Place the 2 slices of bread on top of the omelette in the pan, gently

        is golden and the eggs are mostly set.

        Now, flip the bread omelette to cook the other side. Add the remaining
        teaspoon of butter around the edges of the omelette.

        Cook until the eggs are fully set and the bread is toasted to your
        desired level of crispiness.
